    <h1>1.0 World Wide Web</h1>
        <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, commonly known as the Web, is an 
            information system where documents and other web resources
            are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr>, such
            as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by
            hyperlinks, and are accessiple over the Internet. [1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the
            Hypertext Transfer Protocol <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">(HTTP)</abbr>, may be accessed by useres
            by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web
            server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over
            two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built</p>

    <h2>1.1 History</h2>
        <p>The underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as the 
            Hypertex Editing System <abbr title="Hypertext Editing System">(HES)</abbr> at Brown University, Ted Nelson's
            Project Xanadu, and Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System <abbr title="oN-Line System">(NLS)</abbr>.
            Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's microfilm-based memex, which was
            described in the 1945 essay <cite>As We May Think</cite>.[12] Tim Berners-Lee's vision of global hyperlinked
            information system became a posibilityby the second half of the 1980s.[13] By 1985, the global Internet
            began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name System (upon which the Uniform Resource Locator is built)
            came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and
            Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the posibility of a web-like system at CERN.[14]

    <h2>1.2 Function</h2>
        <p>The terms Internet and <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> are often used without much distinction. 
            However, the two terms do not mean
            the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In contrast, the
            <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> is a global collection of documents and other resources, 
            linked by hyperlinks and <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URIs</abbr>. Web resources
            are accessed using <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> or 
            <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure">HTTPS</abbr>, 
            whic are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internets
            transport protocols.[41]
        </p>
    
    <h3>1.2.1 HTML</h3>
        <p><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and
            web applications. With <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript, it forms a triad of
            cornerstone technologies for the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>.[43]
        </p>
    <h3>1.2.2 Linking</h3>
        <p>Most web pages contains hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents,
            definitions and other we resources. In the underlying <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
            a hyperlink looks like this: <a href="https://example.org/homepage">example.org Homepage</a>
        </p>
    <h3>1.2.3 WWW prefix</h3>
        <p>Many hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with www because of the long-standing practice of naming
            Internet hosts according to the services they provide. The hostname of a web server is often www, in the same
            way it may be ftp for an <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> server, and news or nntp for a Usenet news server.
        </p>
    <h1>2.0 Internet</h1>
        <p>The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite 
            (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, 
            business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical 
            networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked 
            hypertext documents and applications of the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
        </p>
    <h2>2.1 Terminology</h2>
        <p>The word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven.[7] The word Internet was used in 
            1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork.[8] Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of 
            interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks.[9]
        </p>
    <h2>2.2 History</h2>
        <p>In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense funded research 
            into time-sharing of computers.[14][15][16] Research into packet switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies,
            started in the work of Paul Baran in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies in 1965.[1][17] After the Symposium 
            on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed NPL network was incorporated into the design 
            for the ARPANET and other resource sharing networks such as the Merit Network and CYCLADES, which were developed in the 
            late 1960s and early 1970s.[18]
